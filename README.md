This Repo includes the testing codes of our HAAM-GAN. (PyTorch Version).

If you use our code, please cite our paper and hit the star at the top-right corner. Thanks!


# Requirement
```
Python 3.7, Pytorch 1.11.0.
```


# Testing
```
1. Download the code
2. Put your testing images in the "data/input" folder
3. Python test.py
4. Find the result in "data/ouput" folder
5. You can find all the pre-trained model in
